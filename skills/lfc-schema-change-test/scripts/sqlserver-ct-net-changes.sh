# sqlserver-ct-net-changes.sh: with a gateway that runs all the time, does a change-tracking table get every update of a
# row, and is every table read on every poll? (lfc-faq #39: rows updated every minute, the gateway polls every few
# seconds, not every update shows.) Change tracking keeps which rows changed, not each value: a read returns the row's
# value at that moment, so the updates between two reads of a table arrive as one.
#
# The result ends with the data: the values written (with their source time) next to what each kind of table kept.
#
# Tables (10 rows each): ct1 (change tracking, SCD type 1), c2 (CDC, SCD type 2: the control, which keeps every
# change), t01..tNN (change tracking, SCD type 2). Burst: every BURST_GAP seconds for BURST_N rounds, id 1 of every
# table gets v = i<round>; then id 2 gets f1..f5 back to back (5 commits within milliseconds). After the gateway caught up
# and an ingestion update applied it, an SCD type 2 table holds one version per value its reads saw: the gaps between
# kept rounds show how often the gateway read that table.
#
#   TABLES_N (20) change-tracking SCD type 2 tables; BURST_N (60) rounds, BURST_GAP (2) seconds apart.
#   The connection's login gets VIEW SERVER STATE for the run (SCD type 2 on change tracking needs it, lfc-faq #23).
#   Needs and options: as sqlserver-add-column.sh (PROFILE CONNECTION CATALOG SRC_SQL CONN_USER; SRC_ENV, KEEP, OUT)
