#   How big is the source behind a UC connection? Runs the engine's catalog query through the connection with
#   remote_query (read-only, from serverless; no table scans, no count(*)), saves one row per table to DIR/tables.csv,
#   and prints: the database total (for the infrastructure team), the data Lakeflow Connect moves (table data and
#   large values, no indexes), rows and average row size, the largest tables, and tables whose row sources disagree.
#   PostgreSQL, SQL Server, CockroachDB and YugabyteDB need --database; Oracle --service (the PDB). MySQL covers every user database at once.
#   MariaDB uses the MySQL query (its connection is a MYSQL one; no PROCESS variant: MariaDB has no innodb_tablespaces).
#   CockroachDB and YugabyteDB: a POSTGRESQL connection and the PostgreSQL query (--database, as for PostgreSQL).
#   Db2 and Informix have no Unity Catalog connection type: run scripts/db2.sql or scripts/informix.sql with the engine's client.
