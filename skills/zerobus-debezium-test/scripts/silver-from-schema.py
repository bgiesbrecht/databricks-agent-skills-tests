# silver-from-schema.py: a Lakeflow Spark Declarative Pipelines source file that builds silver from the canonical
# schema (statschema's schema.yaml, from the lfc-source-statschema skill) in a Unity Catalog Volume. The one generator
# for every source, every model and every bronze layout: nothing in it names a table, a column or a type.
#
# Sources: <volume>/_sources.yaml lists every source database (host) feeding this silver, each with the change log's
# destination prefix (destination = <prefix>.<table>, e.g. crdb1.public.orders), its T, and its snapshot format. The
# same logical table from many sources merges into one silver table; with source_key: true the key is (_source, the
# primary key), so identical keys from different hosts stay apart, and each key's changes are ordered within its own
# source only. Every silver row carries _source (the destination prefix).
#
# For every table in <volume>/_schema/schema.yaml (or _schema/tables/<table>.yaml, which wins: one table's evolved
# schema, written without touching the others) it defines, when the pipeline starts:
#   <table>_snapshot        every source's snapshot as of its T, from <volume>/<table>/<prefix>/ (Parquet or CSV); a
#                           table with no files there (CockroachDB writes none for an empty table) has an empty one.
#                           <volume>/_snapshot.tsv (table, prefix, format, files), when there is one, says which do,
#                           so 10,000s of folders aren't listed when the pipeline starts
#   <table>_changes         the table's events in the change log, sequenced by the event's position in its source
#   <table>_changes_dedup   the same, producer replays removed
#   <table>                 current rows (AUTO CDC, SCD type 1)
#   <table>_history         every version (AUTO CDC, SCD type 2), replays removed; the suffix is cdc.history_suffix
#                           (default _history; TPC-E has both holding and holding_history, so there it can't be)
# and, for the table in cdc.nodedup_table, <table>_history_nodedup (SCD type 2 with the replays). A table without a
# primary key (TPC-B's and TPC-C's history) is append-only: <table> gets the snapshot rows and the inserts, appended.
# Dates, timestamps and times are decoded from either form a producer sends: text (CockroachDB's changefeed, the
# snapshot) or a number (Debezium's PostgreSQL connector: days, epoch milli- or microseconds, microseconds of the day).
# A time is kept as text, HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.
#
# Schema drift (cdc.on_drift = record, the default): silver keeps flowing on the columns it knows. A value that doesn't
# fit its column's type becomes NULL, a column that's gone gets its default (or NULL), a new column waits; and each one
# is recorded once per (table, source, kind, column) in schema_drift (kind: type, missing, new; with the last position
# and a sample). Evolution is asynchronous and per table: write that table's new schema to _schema/tables/<table>.yaml
# and full-refresh it (the change log is append-only VARIANT, so it catches up from bronze); the other tables never
# stop, and neither does the change log: a new column or a new table needs no DDL there. cdc.on_drift = fail casts
# strictly, so an update stops at the first value that doesn't fit.
#
# Pipeline configuration:
#   cdc.volume            /Volumes/<catalog>/<schema>/<volume>
#   cdc.bronze            the change log's shape: zerobus (Debezium Server's sink) or kafka (Kafka Connect, Kafka API)
#   cdc.bronze_table      the change-log table each silver table reads: cdc_log (one log for every table, the default),
#                         cdc_log_{table} (one per table) or cdc_log_s{shard} (cdc.bronze_shards logs, by table)
#   cdc.bronze_table.<t>  one table's own bronze table, over cdc.bronze_table: a table moved out of the shared log
#                         (fanout.py --tables <t>, or a producer routing it), while the others stay; changing it
#                         takes a full refresh of that table, from a bronze table that holds its history from T
#   cdc.bronze_shards     for {shard}: how many (fanout.py writes them with the same rule)
#   cdc.shard             i/n: this pipeline builds only the tables with crc32(name) % n == i, so 10,000s of tables
#                         spread over n pipelines (default: every table)
#   cdc.history_suffix    the SCD type 2 tables' suffix (default _history); a source table with that name stops the start
#   cdc.nodedup_table, cdc.on_drift (record | fail), cdc.drift_sample (check one event in n for drift, default 1)
#   cdc.seq               what orders a key's events: ts_ns (the event's time, the default) or binlog (MySQL: the binlog
#                         file's number, the event's position in it and the row in the event, (file << 44) + (pos << 12) +
#                         row, exact and the same for a replay; a source's T is the snapshot's position in that form)
#                         or lsn (PostgreSQL: the change's LSN; a source's T is its replication slot's), or change_lsn
#                         (SQL Server: source.change_lsn's file, offset and slot as one number; T is the log's last LSN),
#                         or scn (Oracle: the change's SCN; T is the database's current SCN), or db2_lsn (Db2: the low 8
#                         bytes of source.change_lsn, the third of its parts; T is the ASN capture's synch point), or
#                         ifx_lsn (Informix: source.change_lsn, a number; T is 0, Debezium starting after the snapshot)
#   cdc.binary            hex: binary values come as hex text (Debezium's binary.handling.mode=hex, and the snapshot)
#   cdc.fk_actions        apply: the change log lacks the rows foreign keys' ON DELETE CASCADE / SET NULL change (MySQL
#                         through 9.5, MariaDB), so silver derives them from each parent delete and the schema's
#                         on_delete, into the child's targets and fk_actions (the trace); logged (default): it has them
#   cdc.fk_depth          how many levels of derived deletes to follow (chains, a table referencing itself; default 4)
# A source in _sources.yaml may carry csv: {option: value} for its CSV snapshot files (MySQL's INTO OUTFILE writes NULL
# as \N and escapes with a backslash).
#
# The table plan: <volume>/_plan.yaml, when there is one (cdc-table-plan's classify.py, checked and edited by the
# customer), says what each table gets: silver: [scd1] (current rows), [scd2] (history only), [scd1, scd2], or [append]
# (the snapshot rows and the inserts, appended: no MERGE; an update or delete of such a table is left out, and the
# harness counts them). A table it doesn't list gets the default: scd1 and scd2 with a key, append without one.
