"""placement.py: where each table goes, from a placement file (composite topology), as one TSV row a table.

usage: placement.py <placement.yaml> <tables file, one name a line> > placement.tsv

placement.yaml: groups, tried in order; a table goes to the first that names it (tables) or matches it (match, a
regular expression over the whole name). A table no group takes is an error.

  groups:
    - name: busy
      tables: [customers, orders]
      producer: {servers: 1}            # Debezium Servers for this group's tables (crc32(name) % servers)
      bronze: own                       # own: cdc_log_<table>, written by the fan-out from cdc_log; shared: cdc_log
      silver: {mode: pipeline}          # pipeline (AUTO CDC) or merge (merge-silver.py jobs)
    - name: quiet
      match: ".*"
      producer: {servers: 2}
      bronze: shared
      silver: {mode: merge, jobs: 2}    # jobs: merge-silver.py jobs for the group (crc32(name) % jobs)

Output columns: table, group, bronze (own | shared), silver (pipeline | merge), server (a global index over every
group's servers, in group order), silver shard, silver shards (the group's jobs; 1 for a pipeline).
