# Debezium: settings, event size and commit time

## The Debezium settings that matter

- `debezium.sink.type=zerobus`, with `endpoint`, `workspace.url`, `client.id` and `client.secret` (the service principal) under `debezium.sink.zerobus.`.
- `payload.mode=envelope` with `debezium.sink.zerobus.table=<catalog>.<schema>.cdc_log`: every source table's events go to one table, so a new source table or column needs no DDL in Databricks.
- `json.flexible.fields.encoding=string` into `VARIANT` columns: the sink sends `key`, `value`, `source_position` and `headers` as JSON text, and Zerobus parses it into `VARIANT`. `object` (nested JSON) is rejected by Zerobus: "Record decoder/encoder error: invalid type: map, expected a string" (`NonRetriableException`). Read the fields with paths, for example `value:after:tier::STRING`; the record's `key` holds the primary key columns. The source table is in `destination` (`crdb.<schema>.<table>`); `target_table` is always the log itself.
- No tombstones: `tombstones.on.delete=false` and `tombstone.handling.mode=drop`. A delete is one `delete` event.
- Only Kafka's own transforms: the Debezium Server 3.7.0.Final image ships `connect-transforms` 4.3.1 but not `io.debezium.transforms.ExtractNewRecordState` (`ClassNotFoundException`), which typed mode needs. `ReplaceField` (what `DROP_FIELDS` uses) removes top-level fields only. Of the Kafka transforms, only `ExtractField` takes nested paths, so `source` can be dropped whole but not trimmed field by field.
- `snapshot.mode=no_data` with `cockroachdb.changefeed.cursor=<T>`: the feed starts at the snapshot time and Debezium takes no snapshot.
- `idempotency.mode=source` gives each row an `idempotency_key`, but Zerobus doesn't deduplicate by it, and with this connector it isn't unique per change ([Round 3](rounds.md#round-3-debezium-killed-and-restarted)).
- CockroachDB: `kv.rangefeed.enabled = true`; the connector uses a sinkless changefeed (`changefeed.sink.type=sinkless`), so no Kafka or cloud storage sits in between.

## Event size: what each setting saved

Measured on 2026-10-20 (CockroachDB v25.4.13, Debezium Server 3.7.0.Final, `json.flexible.fields.encoding=string`). The table shows average bytes per event in the change log; `value` is the event body, and `total` adds the key, the position and the headers.

| Run | Top-level keys in `value` | create: total / value | update: total / value | delete: total / value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Envelope, `extended.headers.enabled=false`, `include.diff=false`, tombstones off | after, before, op, source, transaction, ts_ms, ts_ns, ts_us | 700 / 459 | 748 / 507 | 695 / 454 |
| Same, plus `DROP_FIELDS=before,transaction,ts_ms,ts_us` | after, op, source, ts_ns | 620 / 379 | 625 / 384 | 576 / 335 |
| **Saved by `DROP_FIELDS`** | | **80 (11%)** | **123 (16%)** | **119 (17%)** |
| Same, plus `source`: `DROP_FIELDS=before,transaction,ts_ms,ts_us,source` | after, op, ts_ns | 336 / 95 | 342 / 101 | 292 / 51 |
| **Saved by dropping `source`** | | **284 (46%)** | **283 (45%)** | **284 (49%)** |
| **Saved in all, from the first row** | | **364 (52%)** | **406 (54%)** | **403 (58%)** |

How the create event splits up before `source` is dropped: `source` 274 B, position 160 B, `after` 48 B, key 8 B, headers 2 B. The first runs, before extended headers and the before-image were off, measured about 1.2 KB per event.

Dropping `source` loses nothing silver can use. The source table is in `destination`, and `source`'s times aren't the commit time (see [Commit time](#commit-time-not-in-the-event-cockroachdb-connector-370final)). All claims passed with it dropped. Keep the top-level `ts_ns`: silver sequences by it. Most of what's left is the position (160 B), which the sink writes and `DROP_FIELDS` can't reach.

## Commit time: not in the event (CockroachDB connector 3.7.0.Final)

CockroachDB's changefeed sends each row's commit time (`updated`, or `source.ts_hlc` with `enriched_properties = 'source'`, a nanosecond HLC). The connector drops it. In the event, `source.ts_hlc` is null, and `source.ts_ns` / `ts_ms` and the position's `offset.cursor` hold the connector's offset time, which advances only on resolved timestamps. Measured on 2026-10-20: 8 changes committed within 4 ms of each other, at `...511.329226021` s, all carried `source.ts_ns = ...481000000000`, a whole second 30 s earlier. Setting `cockroachdb.changefeed.enriched.properties=source` (`ENRICHED_PROPERTIES=source`) changed nothing: the same null `ts_hlc`, the same bytes. In the bytecode, the connector reads only `schema_name` and `table_name` from the changefeed's source block, and nothing calls `SourceInfo.setHlc`.

So silver can't sequence by the commit time. What's left is the top-level `ts_ns`: when Debezium processed the event, in nanoseconds, distinct for all 8 changes. It still orders each key's changes. A changefeed emits each key's changes in commit order, and one Debezium Server processes them one at a time. After a restart, Debezium re-sends the changes after its offset, in order, with later `ts_ns`. It's Debezium's clock, though, not the database's. The snapshot is sequenced by T, from the database's clock, so the two only compare correctly when the clocks agree, as they do on one VM.
